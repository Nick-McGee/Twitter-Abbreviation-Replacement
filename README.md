# Twitter Abbreviation Replacement
COSC 320 Group Project to replace abbreviations with their full words, specifically Tweets.

### Usage
Datasets have to be manually changed in the source code. Currently, the sxswTweets.csv is used. See below for more datasets used in the analysis.

**REQUIREMENTS:** The abr.csv must be a csv file with the each abbreviation in the first column, and the the corresponding full value in the second column. Each row is one entry. The Tweet file reads Tweets line by line.
